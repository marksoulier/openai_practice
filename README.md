## Obtaining an API Key

Before you can use the OpenAI library, you'll need to obtain an API key from OpenAI. Here's how to do it:

1. Go to the [OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) and sign up for an account if you haven't already.
2. Once you've signed up and logged in, navigate to the API section.
3. Follow the instructions to generate a new API key.
4. Once you have your API key, you can use it in your project by setting it as an environment variable or by including it in your code in a secure manner.

Remember to keep your API key private and never expose it in your public code repository.
